# Working on the Pi

When working on this project, you have a couple of options for how you want to make changes to your code:

1. Working directly on the Pi
2. Working on a personal computer, and pushing changes to the Pi

We usually would recommend working directly on the Raspberry Pi with something like SSH or VNC Viewer to see your changes in real-time (this helps with debugging), however it is not always possible to do this. When working remotely or away from your team, you should utilize Github to save your changes, and pull them to the Raspberry Pi later.

In either case, you should regularly back up your work using git and Github.
