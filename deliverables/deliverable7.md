# Deliverable 7

In Deliverable 7, you'll continue working on your Etch-A-Sketch mode with the aim of having it completed, meaning it achieves all of the requested functionality outlined in the [README](../README.md) and [Deliverable 6](deliverable6.md) adequately. 

For this weeks deliverable, simply keep working on your project with the aim of having your more stubborn features such as step size/speed adjustment implemented. Since the submission for this deliverable is an in-person demo, you won't need to strictly submit anything unless circumstances arise. Even though it is not a submission, you should still make sure your documentation is up to date on Etch-A-Sketch mode while it is fresh in the mind.
