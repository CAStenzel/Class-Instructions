# Deliverable 2

For this week, you'll be documenting the behavior of the existing XY-Plotter provided, modifying it for use with the new Raspberry Pi hardware, and going through the preliminary setup for the Raspberry Pi hardware.

Right now would also be a good time to read through the rules for the project outlined [in the README](../README.md) for this repository.

## Documenting Existing Behavior and Modifying the Plotter

For this section of the deliverable, you'll be following [this guide](./setup/plotter_setup.md) to assemble and modify your plotter.

## Raspberry Pi Setup

Finally, you'll need to go through the Raspberry Pi setup documentation found [here](setup/pi_setup.md). It will guide you through setting up the Pi and getting all of the Python dependencies and environment set up. It will also link to helpful documentation for how to work on the Raspberry Pi, remotely or otherwise.
