# Deliverable 2

[//]: # (TODO: Ask herring what "Students make attendance sheet" means, if it's required in these deliverable instrutions)
For this week, you'll be aquiring your hardware for your group, documenting the behavior of the exsisting XY-Plotter provided, modifying it for use with the new Raspberry Pi hardware, and going through the preliminary setup for your Raspberry Pi hardware. 

Right now would also be a good time to read through the rules for the project outlined [in the README](../README.md) for this repository.

## Aquire Hardware (TODO)

[//]: # (TODO: Document aquiring hardware instructions when information becomes available)

## Documenting Exsisting Behavior and Modifying the Plotter

For this section of the deliverable, you'll be following [this guide](./setup/plotter_setup.md) to assemble and modify your plotter. Instructions and deliverable submission requirements are listed in the guide.

## Raspberry Pi Setup

Finally, you'll need to go through the Raspberry Pi setup documentation found [here](setup/pi_setup.md). It will guide you through setting up the Pi and getting all of the Python dependancies and environment set up. It will also link to helpful documentation for how to work on the Raspberry Pi, remotely or otherwise.
