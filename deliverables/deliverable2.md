# Deliverable 2

[//]: # (TODO: Ask herring what "Students make attendance sheet" means, if it's required in these deliverable instrutions)
For this week, you'll be aquiring your hardware for your group, documenting the behavior of the exsisting XY-Plotter provided, disassembling it with the instructions provided below, and going through the preliminary setup for your Raspberry Pi hardware. 

Right now would also be a good time to read through the rules for the project outlined [here](/.../rules.md),

## Aquire Hardware

[//]: # (TODO: Document aquiring hardware instructions when information becomes available)

## Document Exsisting Behavior

[//]: # (TODO: Ask Rachel where her documentation is for setting the Plotter up is)

## Disassembling the Plotter

[//]: # (TODO: Ask Rachel where her documentation is for disassembling the plotter)

## Raspberry Pi Setup

Finally, you'll need to go through the Raspberry Pi setup documentation found [here](../setup/initial_setup.md). It will guide you through setting up the Pi and getting all of the Python dependancies and environment set up. It will also link to helpful documentation for how to work on the Raspberry Pi, remotely or otherwise.
